Software Testing Portfolio

Hands-on QA portfolio demonstrating **manual testing**, **API testing**, and **test automation** using **Pytest** and **Playwright**.  
This repository is built to show practical testing skills with real artifacts (test plan, bug reports, automated tests, and project structure).
